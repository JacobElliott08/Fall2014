To compile my code you must be in the folder before assignment, from there you can compile on the command line using javac assignment/DayPlannerDemo.java this will compile the code and then you can type java assignment/DayPlannerDemo this will run the code DayPlannerDemo.

You will be given a high-level menu option that looks like :
1. Add Activity
2. Search for an Activity
Quit

To access the first option you can type 1 or Add, both will be accepted, similarly you can type 2 or search, and for quit you can simply type q, or quit.

After making the selection to add the activity you will be prompted to choose what type of activity you want add. You can either add a home activity, a school activity or an other activity. Home, School, and Other all require a couple of basic information such as : Title, Start Time, End Time, and an additional optional comment. If you are adding an Other Activity type you will also be required to add a location. Start Time and End Time both require you to enter Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute. Your end time must occur after your start time.

You can only add ten types of each activities.

To search for an activity, you must again choose if you want to search through the home, school, or other activities. After you select that everything from there is optional.
It will ask you if you want to enter a start date and end date you can enter n or no if you want to skip start time, and finally it will ask you if you want to enter any additional search information. It will then print out all possible matches.

To test my code I first started with adding activities, making sure I could add each type of activity. After that I tested the component that checked to make sure the end date came after the start date. After that I started testing the search algorithm.
