To compile my code you must be in the folder before assignment, from there you can compile on the command line using javac assignment/AssignmentThree.java this will compile the code.

To run my code, you must be in the same folder you compiled in ’src’ and then you must type java assignment/AssignmentThree this will run the GUI, you can navigate the GUI how you wish, you can load or save files, add new activities and search from the pre-existing entries in the search frame.

The prompts in each panel will help guide you on how to use the GUI properly.

If you wish to use the in and out file please consider the following :

You should add a blank activity and save it, from there you can view the output format and the input format, and create your own in file.

Some extra stuff I worked on was making the fields turn red when invalid information was entered.
