I started building incrementally, I started with the base class where three panels were loading on the screen and you could switch between each of them. From there I built up the add panel only, created itâ€™s functionality and agreed on a set design for the GUI layout. I then created the searching frame, took the same steps to design the GUI layout and make sure things were resizable and nothing would go askew.
Some bonus stuff was the highlighting of invalid fields, saving and loading files.
